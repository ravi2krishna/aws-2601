    -> AWS - Amazon Web Services 

        -> Cloud Computing 

            -> Any Application has data 

                -> Data is in Servers 

                    -> Categorized into Web Servers (Public Data - images)
                    and Database Servers(Private Data - Cards, Address etc)

                -> Where are this servers ? 

                    -> Servers are hosted in Datacenters 

                -> Datacenters can be Categorized into 

                    -> On Premise Datacenters (Physical)

                    -> Cloud Datacenters (Virtually)

        -> Datacenter

            -> A data center is a building, a dedicated space within a building, 
            or a group of buildings used to house computer systems and 
            associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems.

            -> Managing Datacenters is Expensive & Hard To Maintain 

    -> Cloud Computing

        -> ‘The Cloud’ can also refer to Cloud computing is the 
        "on-demand" availability of compute power, database storage, 
        applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform 
        (AWS/AZURE/GCP/Oracle etc) via the "internet" with "pay-as-you-go" pricing.

        -> Cloud Computing is very close to Online Ride Services 
        like ola, rapido etc

24th Feb 2026
=============

    -> Platform As A Service - PaaS 

        -> Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model providing a complete, 
        ready-to-use platform—infrastructure, middleware, and development tools—for developing, 
        running, and managing applications over the internet. 
        
        -> It allows developers to focus on coding and deployment while 
        providers handle servers, storage, networking, and OS updates.

        -> Database as a platform (RDS)

    
    -> Software As A Service - SaaS 

        -> Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud-based model where providers 
        deliver applications over the internet on a subscription basis, 
        managing all infrastructure, security, and updates. 
        
        -> Users access software via web browsers, eliminating the need for 
        local installation and maintenance. 
        
        -> Examples include Office 365, Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Slack.

                + 
            -> etc 


    -> New Approach (Setting Up Application Infrastructure On Cloud Datacenter)

        -> Flipkart Ecommerce Application

            -> Servers          - AWS EC2 
                +                   +
            -> Storage          - AWS S3 
                +                   +
            -> Databases        - AWS RDS   ======>  Application
                +                   +
            -> Networking       - AWS VPC 
                +                   +
            -> Security         - AWS IAM 
                +                   + 
            -> etc              - etc 

    
    -> Application should have following characteristics (Four Pillars Of Cloud)

        -> Highly Available 

            -> High availability in AWS ensures that applications are 
            continuously accessible and operational

        -> Fault Tolerant 

            -> Fault tolerance in AWS refers to the ability of a system to 
            continue operating without interruption in the face of hardware failures

        -> Scalable  

            -> Scalability in AWS refers to the ability of a system to handle 
            increasing workloads and accommodate growing demands. 

        -> Secured 

            -> Security in AWS refers to the measures taken to protect cloud resources, 
            data, and applications from unauthorized access.

=============

    -> Infrastructure As A Service - IaaS 

        -> AWS Global Infrastructure 

            ->  Amazon Cloud Computing resources (servers, storage, databases etc) 
            are available across the world. 

            -> In simple terms if we see this https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/ 
            with above map we can say Amazon Datacenters are available in different parts of the world 

        -> In terms of AWS, infrastructure is made up of 

            -> Regions 

            -> Availability Zones
        
                -> https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Beres/publication/360541079/figure/fig1/AS:1154856056291328@1652350548135/AWS-Regions-and-Availability-Zones-Scott-nd.ppm

            -> Edge Locations

        -> Regions

            -> Regions are designed to service AWS customers (or your users) 
            that are located closest to a region.

            -> Availability of Services are different for different AWS Regions.

            -> Price varies from region to region

        -> Availability zone (AZ)

            -> Availability zone is where the actual data centers are located

                -> https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Beres/publication/360541079/figure/fig1/AS:1154856056291328@1652350548135/AWS-Regions-and-Availability-Zones-Scott-nd.ppm

            -> Within a Region, there can be multiple Availability zones

            -> Each AZ has independent Power Supply, Networking, Cooling System, Physical Security.


        -> Edge locations

            -> An AWS Edge Location is a data center in the AWS global network used by services 
            like CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and Lambda@Edge to "store cached content" 
            (images, videos) and process requests closer to end-users, 
            drastically reducing latency by serving data from the nearest point of presence(pop) 
            rather than a distant main AWS Region. 
            They act as caching warehouses, improving performance for websites.

            -> A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers 
            that caches content (images, video, HTML, JS) closer to end-users, 
            significantly improving website speed, reducing latency, lowering bandwidth costs

=============

    -> Virtual Private Cloud - VPC 

        -> A Virtual Private Cloud is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted 
        within a public cloud. 

            -> https://images.netcomlearning.com/cms/images/virtual-private-cloud.jpg

        -> VPC customers can run code, store data, host websites & applications in isolated mode

            -> https://tudip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Virtual-Private-Cloud-Unify-2015.png

        -> NOTE: Having VPC is similar to having your own data center inside AWS. 

        -> VPC is a service that lets customers(IBM) provision a logically isolated 
        section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources(Servers) 
        in a VIRTUAL NETWORK that you define.

        -> VPC Architecture Reference 

            -> https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFI8sqvP4xFFQ/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1700537758681?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=zE97TFGw5FQJEjUksqx7SohNsqqV57-IYQ_pj7K2M2U

    -> VPC Components 

        -> Internet Gateway 

        -> Subnets 

            -> Public Subnets 

            -> Private Subnets

        -> Route Tables 

            -> Public Route Tables

            -> Private Route Tables

        -> Network Access Control List - NACL (Firewall - 1)

        -> Security Groups (Firewall - 2)


    -> VPC Components Scenario From Real World Application

        -> VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

            -> A VPC is the private network where the entire Myntra application infrastructure 
            (web servers, app servers, databases) is hosted securely in the cloud.
            It provides isolation and control over IP ranges, 
            routing, and security for the application environment.

        -> Internet Gateway (IGW)

            -> An Internet Gateway allows public users (customers browsing myntra.com) 
            to access the application servers hosted inside the VPC.
            It acts as the entry and exit point between the internet and the cloud network.

        -> Subnets

            -> Subnets divide the VPC into smaller networks to separate application layers like 
            web, application, and database tiers.
            This improves security and organization by controlling which resources can 
            communicate with each other.
        
        -> Public Subnets

            -> Public subnets host components that must be accessible from the internet, 
            such as load balancers or web servers serving Myntra’s website.
            They are connected to the Internet Gateway through route tables 
            to allow incoming user traffic.

        -> Private Subnets

            -> Private subnets host sensitive components like application servers and databases 
            that should not be directly exposed to the internet.
            They can communicate internally within the VPC while remaining protected 
            from external access.

        -> Route Tables

            -> Route tables define how traffic flows between different parts of the 
            Myntra infrastructure and the internet.
            They determine whether traffic goes to internal services, other subnets, 
            or outside via the Internet Gateway.

        -> Public Route Tables

            -> Public route tables contain routes that send traffic to the Internet Gateway, 
            enabling internet access for public-facing components.
            They ensure users can reach the Myntra website hosted in public subnets.

        -> Private Route Tables

            -> Private route tables restrict direct internet access and route traffic 
            only within the internal network or through NAT services if needed.
            They protect backend systems like databases from external exposure.

        -> Network Access Control List (NACL) — Firewall Level 1

            -> NACL acts as a subnet-level firewall controlling which traffic is allowed or denied 
            into subnet layers of the Myntra infrastructure.
            It provides an additional security boundary before traffic reaches individual servers.

        -> Security Groups — Firewall Level 2

            -> Security Groups act as instance-level firewalls that control which users or services 
            can access specific servers (like web or database servers).
            They ensure only required ports (like HTTPS 443) are open for Myntra’s application components.
