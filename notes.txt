    -> AWS - Amazon Web Services 

        -> Cloud Computing 

            -> Any Application has data 

                -> Data is in Servers 

                    -> Categorized into Web Servers (Public Data - images)
                    and Database Servers(Private Data - Cards, Address etc)

                -> Where are this servers ? 

                    -> Servers are hosted in Datacenters 

                -> Datacenters can be Categorized into 

                    -> On Premise Datacenters (Physical)

                    -> Cloud Datacenters (Virtually)

        -> Datacenter

            -> A data center is a building, a dedicated space within a building, 
            or a group of buildings used to house computer systems and 
            associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems.

            -> Managing Datacenters is Expensive & Hard To Maintain 

    -> Cloud Computing

        -> ‘The Cloud’ can also refer to Cloud computing is the 
        "on-demand" availability of compute power, database storage, 
        applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform 
        (AWS/AZURE/GCP/Oracle etc) via the "internet" with "pay-as-you-go" pricing.

        -> Cloud Computing is very close to Online Ride Services 
        like ola, rapido etc 

    
    -> Cloud Offerings

        -> Infrastructure As A Service - IaaS 

            -> Hardware (Managed By Cloud Vendor i.e AWS)

                -> Provides servers, storage, networking, and virtualization

                -> You as a Customer, responsible for 

                    -> Managing Operating Systems 

                    -> Managing Libraries and Binaries For Your Softwares 

                    -> Managing Your Softwares 

                    -> NW - Servers (VPC - EC2)


        -> Platform As A Service - PaaS 
        

        -> Software As A Service - SaaS 


24th Feb 2026
=============

    -> Platform As A Service - PaaS 

        -> Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model providing a complete, 
        ready-to-use platform—infrastructure, middleware, and development tools—for developing, 
        running, and managing applications over the internet. 
        
        -> It allows developers to focus on coding and deployment while 
        providers handle servers, storage, networking, and OS updates.

        -> Database as a platform (RDS)

    
    -> Software As A Service - SaaS 

        -> Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud-based model where providers 
        deliver applications over the internet on a subscription basis, 
        managing all infrastructure, security, and updates. 
        
        -> Users access software via web browsers, eliminating the need for 
        local installation and maintenance. 
        
        -> Examples include Office 365, Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Slack.

        -> Company 1 - IaaS (Web Servers)

        -> Company 2 - IaaS (Web Servers) + PaaS (Database Server)

        -> Company 3 - IaaS (Web Servers) + PaaS (Database Server) + SaaS (Email Software)


    -> Traditional Approach (Setting Up Application Infrastructure On Physical Datacenter)

        -> Flipkart Ecommerce Application 

            -> Servers 
                +
            -> Storage 
                +
            -> Databases                ======>  Application
                +
            -> Networking
                +
            -> Security 
                + 
            -> etc 


    -> New Approach (Setting Up Application Infrastructure On Cloud Datacenter)

        -> Flipkart Ecommerce Application

            -> Servers          - AWS EC2 
                +                   +
            -> Storage          - AWS S3 
                +                   +
            -> Databases        - AWS RDS   ======>  Application
                +                   +
            -> Networking       - AWS VPC 
                +                   +
            -> Security         - AWS IAM 
                +                   + 
            -> etc              - etc 

    
    -> Application should have following characteristics (Four Pillars Of Cloud)

        -> Highly Available 

            -> High availability in AWS ensures that applications are 
            continuously accessible and operational

        -> Fault Tolerant 

            -> Fault tolerance in AWS refers to the ability of a system to 
            continue operating without interruption in the face of hardware failures

        -> Scalable  

            -> Scalability in AWS refers to the ability of a system to handle 
            increasing workloads and accommodate growing demands. 

        -> Secured 

            -> Security in AWS refers to the measures taken to protect cloud resources, 
            data, and applications from unauthorized access.

=============

    -> Infrastructure As A Service - IaaS 

        -> AWS Global Infrastructure 

            ->  Amazon Cloud Computing resources (servers, storage, databases etc) 
            are available across the world. 

            -> In simple terms if we see this https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/ 
            with above map we can say Amazon Datacenters are available in different parts of the world 

        -> In terms of AWS, infrastructure is made up of 

            -> Regions 

            -> Availability Zones
        
                -> https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Beres/publication/360541079/figure/fig1/AS:1154856056291328@1652350548135/AWS-Regions-and-Availability-Zones-Scott-nd.ppm

            -> Edge Locations

        -> Regions

            -> Regions are designed to service AWS customers (or your users) 
            that are located closest to a region.

            -> Availability of Services are different for different AWS Regions.

            -> Price varies from region to region

        -> Availability zone (AZ)

            -> Availability zone is where the actual data centers are located

                -> https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Beres/publication/360541079/figure/fig1/AS:1154856056291328@1652350548135/AWS-Regions-and-Availability-Zones-Scott-nd.ppm

            -> Within a Region, there can be multiple Availability zones

            -> Each AZ has independent Power Supply, Networking, Cooling System, Physical Security.


        -> Edge locations

            -> An AWS Edge Location is a data center in the AWS global network used by services 
            like CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and Lambda@Edge to "store cached content" 
            (images, videos) and process requests closer to end-users, 
            drastically reducing latency by serving data from the nearest point of presence(pop) 
            rather than a distant main AWS Region. 
            They act as caching warehouses, improving performance for websites.

            -> A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers 
            that caches content (images, video, HTML, JS) closer to end-users, 
            significantly improving website speed, reducing latency, lowering bandwidth costs
